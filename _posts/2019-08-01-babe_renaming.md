Life is a series of blunders. Each one is a chance to learn. I blundered big, publicly and with full orchestration recently. I learned a lot about many things, including that it is very difficult to find an English word without sexual or negative connotation. But let's start at the beginning.
 
For about 2 years, we have worked on (what is now called) [_magpie](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-site/index.html), a piece of software that was meant to facilitate the creation and dissemination of (behavioral) psychological experiments. "_magpie" is an acronym:
 
![magpie](/mfpics/magpie_logo.png)
 
Before _magpie was called "_magpie", it was called "_babe", which was also acronym: 
 
<img src="/mfpics/babe_logo.png" alt="babe_logo" width="300"/>
 
The choice of "_babe" was a blunder. I chose it because I liked the sound of it, and I associated it with caring affection, closeness, intimacy. (I also associated it with a little piglet, but didn't want to use a piglet-based logo for fear of copyright issues.) That was pretty naive! The word "babe" also serves as a predicate to express superior sexual attractiveness. I thought that if we call the (abstract) product of our labor "_babe", it should be clear enough (not only under the most charitable interpreation) that we do not intend to refer to anything sexual. That is wrong!
