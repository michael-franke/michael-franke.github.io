Life is a series of blunders. Each one is a chance to learn. I blundered big, publicly and with full orchestration recently. I learned a lot about many things, including that it is very difficult to find an English word without sexual or negative connotation. But let's start at the beginning.
 
For about 2 years, we have worked on (what is now called) [_magpie](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-site/index.html), a piece of software that was meant to facilitate the creation and dissemination of (behavioral) psychological experiments. "_magpie" is an acronym:

Before _magpie was called "_magpie", it was called "_babe", which was also acronym:

The choice of "_babe" was a blunder. I chose it (the rest of the team is not to blame at all!) because I liked the sound of it, and I associated it with caring affection, closeness, intimacy. (I also associated it with a cute little piglet movie star.) That was pretty naive! 
 
The word "babe" also serves to refer to people with subjectively high physical attractiveness. I cannot claim that I had not been aware of this use but I thought that if I call the (abstract) product of our labor "_babe", it should be clear enough (not only under the most charitable interpreation) that I do not intend to refer to anything sexual. Now I understand: THAT IS WRONG!
 
Language doesn't simply mean what I want it to mean. That's a [Humpty Dumpty theory of meaning](https://johnmacfarlane.net/135/humpty.html), and it applies equally in the social/subjective-connotational domain. It is enough reason not to use a name that has an obvious sexual connotation that a bystander would feel puzzled by the name, and that said bystander would need to invest extra effort to apply the charity necessary to conclude that the term was used in a non-sexual / non-offensive way. Given that it is easy for the negative connotation to arise, and given that it is easy to avoid the negative connotation by a different name, the choice of "_babe" was a total blunder.
 
We have since renamed the software. I feel sorry for the rest of the team that they had to invest extra effort into the laborious renaming process. I do not feel sorry for myself for struggling extensively to come up with a new acronym. It was quite painful! But, hey, file it as compensation for my Humpty-Dumpty-ness, and: it was a second major learning experience.
 
On the way of finding a new name, I learned how almost any sound sequence that could be or is an English word has either a sexual or negative connotation. My new worst friend over the last two weeks has been the [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com). Here are some of the lowlights of acronym I considered (sticking to an acronym was for sports, obviously). You need to imagine me coming up with a candidate, starting to like it, and only *then* learning about the ridiculous connotations or other uses the word has:
 
1. *"herb"* (helpers for experimental resesarch in the browser): can mean "nerd" or "idiot", especially after [a disastrous advertidinh campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oE5dkTanms) of a large fast food chain in the 80s. 
2. *"hep"* (helpers for making experiments portable): should be the predecessor of "hip" for something cool and fashionable, but there are also the ["hep-hep"-riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hep-Hep_riots)  
3. *"saber"* (simple architecture for browser expeRiments): can mean "pretty lady" or "a man whore or a man who sleeps around excessively with either man or woman" according to the [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Saber).
4. *"fieb"* (framework for interactive experiments in the browser): should remind us for [Fiep Westendorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiep_Westendorp) and her beautiful minimal design, but sound like "feeb" which can mean "idiot"
