Life is a series of blunders. Each one is a chance to learn. I blundered big, publicly and with full orchestration recently. I learned a lot about many things, including that it is very difficult to find an English word without sexual or negative connotation. But let's start at the beginning.
 
For about 2 years, we have worked on (what is now called) [_magpie](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-site/index.html), a piece of software that was meant to facilitate the creation and dissemination of (behavioral) psychological experiments. "_magpie" is an acronym:

Before _magpie was called "_magpie", it was called "_babe", which was also acronym:

The choice of "_babe" was a blunder. I chose it (the rest of the team is not to blame at all!) because I liked the sound of it, and I associated it with caring affection, closeness, intimacy. (I also associated it with a cute little piglet movie star.) That was pretty naive! 
 
The word "babe" also serves to refer to people with subjectively high physical attractiveness. I cannot claim that I had not been aware of this use but I thought that if I call the (abstract) product of our labor "_babe", it should be clear enough (not only under the most charitable interpreation) that I do not intend to refer to anything sexual. Now I understand: THAT IS WRONG!
