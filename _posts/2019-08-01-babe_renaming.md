Life is a series of blunders. Each one is a chance to learn. I blundered big, publicly and with full orchestration recently. I learned a lot about many things, including that it is very difficult to find an English word without sexual or negative connotation. But let's start at the beginning.
 
For about 2 years, we have worked on (what is now called) [_magpie](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-site/index.html), a piece of software that was meant to facilitate the creation and dissemination of (behavioral) psychological experiments. "_magpie" is an acronym which stands for "minimal architecture for the generation of portable interactive experiments".

Before _magpie was called "_magpie", it was called "_babe", which is an acronym for "basic architecture for browser-based experiments".
