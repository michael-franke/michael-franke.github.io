### Schedule: upcoming talks


---------------- ----------------------------------------------------
June 6, 2016\    <span style = "color:firebrick">Sven Lauer</span> (G&ouml;ttingen & Konstanz)\
&nbsp;\          "(Un)conditional imperatives, (un)conditional modals, and (un)conditional endorsement"\
&nbsp;\          (Joint work with Cleo Condoravdi, Stanford University)

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:grey">A modal declarative like (1) can simply report that something is necessary, given a body of rules/laws/regulations, etc. without the speaker taking any position on the matter.\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) (In view of what the law provides,) you have to file a tax return.\
&nbsp;\          Things are different with imperatives. A sentence like (2) apparently indicates that the speaker wants the addressee to file a tax return.\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) File a tax return!\
&nbsp;\          This 'endorsement' implication is unsurprising for 'directive' uses of imperatives as orders, requests, pleas, and so forth, but it can also be detected for other uses of imperatives, e.g. as advice, invitations, permissions and concessions (Schwager, 2006; Kaufmann, 2012; Condoravdi & Lauer, 2012). This indicates that 'endorsement' is a conventional feature of the imperative form.\
&nbsp;\          We probe into the nature of the endorsement inference by examining conditional sentences with modal and imperative consequents, in particular those of the 'anankastic' type:\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) a. If you want to go to Harlem, you have to / should take the A train.\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. If you want to go to Harlem, take the A train.\
&nbsp;\          We show that (i) conditional imperatives give rise to a form of 'conditional endorsement', while conditionalized modal sentences do not; and (ii) that a robust endorsement implication surprisingly 'creeps into' the interpretation of unconditional modal sentences in certain circumstances. We argue that a Condoravdi & Lauer (2012)-style analysis of imperatives is well-equipped to account for (i), and explore several avenues for accounting for the puzzling (ii).</span>\

### Past talks

---------------- ----------------------------------------------------
April 25, 2016\  <span style = "color:firebrick">Thomas Brochhagen</span> (Amsterdam)\
&nbsp;\           "Ambiguity and alignment without a common prior"

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">While ambiguity is a pervasive property of natural language communication, it is often characterized as suboptimal. Notwithstanding, recent investigations have proposed ambiguity's vindication to lie in the exploitation of contextual information. Building on these insights, I propose a signaling model that takes context, as well as interlocutors with heterogeneous contextual expectations, i.e. different priors, into consideration. The talk will deal with the question how prior heterogeneity can be overcome, and on the conditions that ensure successful ambiguous communication. Put differently, we will focus on the question whether and when the claim that context can be exploited is justified if interlocutors do not share the same prior. Our main goal is to put forward a model to evaluate predictions about ambiguity's putative advantages and the involved risk of misunderstanding. In doing so, we will touch upon issues related to lexical ambiguity, linguistic convergence in dialogue, and, if time allows, Horn's division of pragmatic labor.</span>\
