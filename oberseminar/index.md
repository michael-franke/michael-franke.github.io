&nbsp;\          "Convention-formation in iterated reference games"\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">Just as drivers depend on shared behavioral conventions to safely navigate traffic, successful communication depends on a set of shared linguistic conventions. All members of a language community share stable knowledge of global conventions, many of which evolved over long timescales. Yet communication partners are also remarkably flexible in their ability to adapt to local contexts and to dynamically coordinate on local, ad hoc conventions across a relatively small number of repeated interactions. In this talk, I’ll present results from several interactive communication games that investigate the cognitive mechanisms that support such flexibility. First, these results suggest that recent efforts to show failures in flexible social reasoning should in fact be reinterpreted as pragmatic successes. Second, they motivate a theory of local convention-formation where agents, though initially uncertain about word meanings in context, learn from and thus adapt to a partner who is assumed to be using language with such knowledge. We formalize both contributions in a computational model of language understanding as recursive social inference.</span>

&nbsp;\          "Cognition, history and chance in the evolution of visual culture"\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">Worldwide visual culture provides ideal material to test and compare a range of hypotheses coming from cognitive science, cultural evolution, and cultural history. Images, designs and patterns are naturally well documented, and visual cognition is among the least controversial areas of cognitive science. Thus, questions that would receive tentative or debatable answers if asked about languages, or social norms, can be addressed with precision when visual culture is concerned. Two studies will be presented.</span>

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">One describes widespread cognitive constraints on the shape of letters in 116 scripts (Thaï, Greek, Afáka, etc.). Orientation anisotropy, vertical symmetry dominance, and orientation-based segregation of letters, all left a clear mark on most of the world's writing systems. Contrary to the received view in cultural evolution, scripts did not gradually evolve to fit these cognitive constraints, nor did cultural selection play any role in the process.</span>

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">Our second case study focuses on the diffusion of heraldic designs on coats of arms (between the late middle ages and early modern times). These designs could spread by imitation, but given the limited number of motifs and tinctures, the chances for some of them of being independently reinvented were substantial. A model which assumes that heraldic designs diffuse by independent reinvention only was tested on two heraldic corpus. The model predicts the appearance of actual designs in the historical record with surprising accuracy. These two studies suggest ways that a quantified history of visual culture can shed light on mechanisms of cultural change on a vast scale.</span>\

&nbsp;\          "Mentioning atypical properties of objects is communicatively efficient" \

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">What governs how much information speakers include in referring expressions? Atypical properties of objects are more likely to be included in referring expressions than typical ones (Sedivy 2003; Westerbeek et al 2015). For example, speakers are more likely to call a blue banana a “blue banana” and a yellow banana a "banana". A unified account of this phenomenon is lacking. We ask: when should a rational speaker mention an object’s color? Reference production is modeled within the Rational Speech Act framework (Frank & Goodman 2012). Utterances (e.g., “banana”, “blue”, and “blue banana”) are taken to have a graded semantics: rather than assuming all bananas are equally good instances of “banana”, we empirically elicited object-utterance typicality values for all possible utterances. Pragmatic speakers select utterances proportionally to the probability that a literal listener using a graded semantics will select the intended referent. We evaluate the proposed model on a dataset of freely produced referring expressions collected in an interactive reference game experiment via the web. We conclude that the systematicity with which speakers redundantly mention color implicates a system geared towards communicative efficiency rather than towards wasteful overinformativeness, and discuss potential extensions of this approach to other production phenomena, such as optional instrument mention.</span>\

May 29, 2017\    <span style = "color:firebrick">Suzanne Stevenson</span> (Toronto)\

&nbsp;\          "Knowledge mismatch in communicative interaction: Probabilistic weighing of perspectives" \

&nbsp;\          (Joint work with Daphna Heller, Mindaugas Mozuraitis, and Chris Parisien)\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">Knowledge mismatch is inherent to communicative interaction, since conversational partners naturally differ in their knowledge and beliefs.  Effective conversational moves, such as asking a question or referring to an entity, crucially depend then on each participant acting appropriately with respect to which knowledge is privileged (unique to that participant) and which is shared among the participants.  For example, much work in linguistics suggests that a definite referring expression such as the knife must be interpreted in the context of mutual knowledge (“common ground”) in which there is a uniquely identifiable knife relevant to both conversational partners.</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">What has been less clear is the moment-by-moment cognitive processing by which people reconcile knowledge mismatch in language production and interpretation.  We propose a theory and computational model in which differing views of relevant knowledge, both privileged to the individual and shared with the conversational partner, are simultaneously and probabilistically considered at the earliest moments of language processing.  This approach arises from a view of communicative interaction as a process requiring continual and rapid accessing and updating of both privileged and shared knowledge.</span>\

&nbsp;\          "Experimental explorations on grammatical taboos in Standard German"\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">Since about 20 years, the use of experimental methods in syntactic research has been growing steadily. Recently, Sprouse et al. (2013) nevertheless showed that linguists' expert judgements have a very high degree of accuracy as compared to the outcomes of elicitation experiments. </span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">Experimental methods are therefore best applied when complementing, not replacing the traditional method of expert judgements. Such a situation occurs when a phenomenon exceeds the capacities of the expert's judgements. I see (at least) two sources for such excessive demands:</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">A psychological one: differences between expressions might be too subtle to assess reliably from the linguists' armchair (e.g. gradient acceptability, degrees of markedness).</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">A sociological one: certain expressions might have a controversial status within the speech community. The expert judgement (perhaps then even controversial among linguists) in such a situation will only be one opinion among others.</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">Grammatical taboos have both features: they are socioculturally induced instances of grammatical markedness.</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">Grammatical taboos have a paradoxical nature. They are structures or constructions that are part of the language insofar as they are used by the speakers and therefore obviously a natural consequence of the language's grammatical apparatus. Nevertheless speakers at the same time believe (to varying degrees) that they are not part of their language. This is usually due to prescription that can occur in various ways and comes along with a particular ideology of standard language that is dominant within the speech community and therefore also an important influence of participants' behaviour in grammatical experiments.</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">I will present several explorative experimental studies on grammatical taboos. My example cases from standard German are auxiliary "tun", V2-Sentences with "weil", d-Pronouns and the double perfect. I am trying to find answers to the following questions, a.o.:</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">- Can we adjust our experimental methods in order to minimize the influence of  prescription?</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">- Can grammatical taboos be distinguished empirically from other cases of syntactic markedness?</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">- Can we decide for very strong taboos, using experimental methods, whether those are instances of markedness or ungrammaticality?</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">- Can we identify sociolinguistic factors that correlate with subjects' evaluation of grammatical taboos?</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">Two main results of my studies are:</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">i) There is reason to be optimistic with respect to the issue of successfully establishing and evaluating the category of grammatical taboos, using the observational means provided by experimental syntax;</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">ii) There is good reason and perhaps even an urgent need for theoretical and empirical grammarians to include the sociocultural dimension of grammar into their models. ("la langue est un fait social", de Saussure)</span>\

&nbsp;\          "Signaling Games, Sociolinguistic Variation and the Construction of Style"\         
&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">In this presentation, I introduce social meaning games (SMGs), which are developed for the analysis of the strategic aspect of sociolinguistic variation (in the sense of Labov 1963, Labov 1966, et seq.). While remarks have been made (eg. Goffman 1970, Dror et al. 2013, Clark 2014) about the potential usefulness of game theory in the analysis of the meaning of variable linguistic phenomena (for example, variable use of the English (ING) suffix (1)), a general framework uniting variationist sociolinguistics with game theoretic pragmatics has yet to be developed.</span>\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;\
&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">(1) I’m workin’ on it vs I’m working on it..</span>\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;\
&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">I propose that such a unification is possible through the integration of the *Third Wave* approach to the meaning of sociolinguistic variation (see Eckert 2000, 2008, 2012) with signalling games (Lewis 1969) and a Bayesian approach to speaker/listener reasoning (see Oaksford & Chater 2007 for a review). The combination of ‘signaling games + Bayesian reasoning’ has previously been argued to be particularly useful in the analysis of a large class of pragmatic phenomena, including scalar implicatures, manner implicatures and context-sensitive reference (see Franke & Jäger 2016 for an overview)..</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">I define the games and then show the predictions of this framework for both linguistic production and interpretation, as exemplified by the modeling of six empirical studies: .</span>\

&nbsp;\          "Mapping Semantic Networks Across Languages: First Impressions"\
&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">Words carve up human experience into richly structured categories of events, objects, relationships, emotions, and ideas. Categories like these subserve human communication and interaction, but it has long been unclear how similar these categories are for speakers of different languages. Recent progress in applied machine learning and artificial intelligence has resulted in large scale machine-readable representations of semantic networks across many languages. I’ll present some preliminary results of a collaborative project whose goal is to leverage these resources, in combination with more traditional linguistic resources, to map patterns of regularity and diversity across semantic domains in many languages. I’ll also discus ways in which these inferred networks can be fused with agent-based simulation and experimental techniques to model the evolution of semantic systems.</span>\

&nbsp;\          "Manual Response Tracking during Intonation-Based Intention Recognition"\
&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">During the perception of an unfolding speech signal listeners use prosodic information to guide their interpretation of what a speaker intends to communicate. This process can take place long before disambiguating lexical information becomes available, allowing the comprehender to make rapid inferences about what a speaker intends to say, even if these inferences are based on partial information. The inference process can only be fully understood using experimental techniques that measure the real-time integration of prosodic information to resolve temporally ambiguous interpretations. While eye tracking experiments have advanced our knowledge about the real-time integration of prosodic information tremendously, we will propose that tracking hand movements complement existing methodologies and offer low-cost alternatives to eye tracking: It has been demonstrated that continuous nonlinear trajectories recorded from the streaming of x,y coordinates of computer mouse movements can serve as an informative indicator of cognitive processes. This talk will introduce mouse tracking as a tool for speech scientists, capable of unravelling the temporal dynamics of speech processing. Additionally, we will present preliminary results of a mouse tracking paradigm attempting to illuminate prosody-based intention recognition. In light of the presented data, we will discuss both methodological advantages and challenges of the proposed paradigm. We hope to convince the audience that mouse tracking is a methodology which holds great promise for low-cost but detailed exploration of fine-grained temporal aspects of speech perception in general and prosody-based intention recognition in particular.</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">Ein besonderes Phänomen des Lautwandels sind Lautwandelketten (engl. chain shifts). Als solche bezeichnet man den Effekt, dass ein Lautwandel einen weiteren Lautwandel auslöst. So kann ein Lautwandel /e/ > /ɪ/ einerseits die Ursache für einen folgenden Lautwandel /ɪ/ > /i/ (sog. Phonologischer Schub, engl. pushing) darstellen, andererseits auch einen Lautwandel /a/ > /e/ nach sich ziehen (sog. Phonologischer Sog, engl. pulling). Mit Hilfe von solchen Verschiebungsketten kann die akustische Distinktivität der Phoneme aufrecht erhalten werden und sind daher u. a. für die Theorie der self organization relevant. Der Vortrag wird das Phänomen aus akustischer, theoretischer und empirischer Sicht thematisieren und die Fragen stellen, wie oft diese erscheinen und wie wichtig sie als Ursache für Lautwandel sind.</span>\

&nbsp;\          "Modeling Word Forms Using Latent Underlying Morphs and Phonology"

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">The observed pronunciations or spellings of words are often explained as arising from the “underlying forms” of their morphemes. These forms are latent strings that linguists try to reconstruct by hand. We propose to reconstruct them automatically at scale, enabling generalization to new words. Given some surface word types of a concatenative language along with the abstract morpheme sequences that they express, we show how to recover consistent underlying forms for these morphemes, together with the (stochastic) phonology that maps each concatenation of underlying forms to a surface form. Our technique involves loopy belief propagation in a natural directed graphical model whose variables are unknown strings and whose conditional distributions are encoded as finite-state machines with trainable weights. We define training and evaluation paradigms for the task of surface word prediction, and report results on subsets of 7 languages.</span>\

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">When speakers of a language communicate with one another, they frequently do so in noisy and sometimes rapidly changing acoustic environments. Language is structured so as to resist these perturbations. I will present two projects on the robustness of spoken language. First, a typological study showing that languages prefer phonemes that are perceptually distinct. Second, an iterated learning experiment showing how robust movement-to-acoustic mappings change the course of language evolution. Together with computational models, these studies show that languages evolve under communicative pressures to maintain function in spite of noise.</span>\

&nbsp;\           "The interaction of functional pressure, redundancy and category variation in phonetic systems"

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">At the level of individual speakers, evidence from natural speech corpora and laboratory investigations shows that the existence of similar lexical items promotes hyperarticulation of phonetic cues that distinguish them. In parallel, at diachronic time-scales evidence suggests that phoneme inventories evolve under the influence of a bias toward maintenance of existing lexico-semantic distinctions. How might these be causally related? Here we present simple exemplar-based simulations that help us explore hypotheses about a general linking mechanism between pressure to maintain lexical contrasts in individual usage events, and maintenance of phonemic contrasts over diachronic time scales. We show that redundancy in sound categories interacts with communicative pressure to modulate ‘cryptic variation’ in sound categories and show that within the model, this sub-phonemic variation shapes future sound change. </span>\

&nbsp;\           "Structural conditions on implicature computation: The latest news"

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">This talk has two goals. First, to introduce the audience to an ongoing and open-ended debate in the field of formal pragmatics. The debate builds on seminal work by R. Katzir (2007, 2008, 2014) and concerns the role of structure in the definition of the set of alternatives that can be used in the computation of (scalar) implicatures. Structural constraints on alternatives have been shown to provide a solution to the so-called Symmetry Problem (Kroch 1972, von Fintel & Heim 1997), and more general well-formedness conditions on alternatives have been argued to underlie otherwise unrelated phenomena (e.g. Meyer 2015). But the idea that alternatives are structural objects which may as such be subject to structural constraints has recently come under attack in view of data that Katzir’s original proposal cannot account for (Swanson 2010, Trinh & Haida 2015, Romoli 2013). These new data will bring us to the second goal of the talk: To present even more new, i.e., newest data. I will argue that most of the seemingly problematic issues have been insufficiently analyzed and that factors which are completely independent of structural constraints on alternatives, viz.,the presupposition of contrastive connectives (e.g., Toosarvandani 2013) and principles of information encoding (e.g., Parikh 2001) have to be taken into account. Once this is accomplished, a new classification of the data ensues which makes it possible to disentangle genuine issues of the structural approach on the one hand, and confounding factors on the other.</span>\

&nbsp;\          "(Un)conditional imperatives, (un)conditional modals, and (un)conditional endorsement"\
&nbsp;\          (Joint work with Cleo Condoravdi, Stanford University)

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:grey">A modal declarative like (1) can simply report that something is necessary, given a body of rules/laws/regulations, etc. without the speaker taking any position on the matter.\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) (In view of what the law provides,) you have to file a tax return.\
&nbsp;\          Things are different with imperatives. A sentence like (2) apparently indicates that the speaker wants the addressee to file a tax return.\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) File a tax return!\
&nbsp;\          This 'endorsement' implication is unsurprising for 'directive' uses of imperatives as orders, requests, pleas, and so forth, but it can also be detected for other uses of imperatives, e.g. as advice, invitations, permissions and concessions (Schwager, 2006; Kaufmann, 2012; Condoravdi & Lauer, 2012). This indicates that 'endorsement' is a conventional feature of the imperative form.\
&nbsp;\          We probe into the nature of the endorsement inference by examining conditional sentences with modal and imperative consequents, in particular those of the 'anankastic' type:\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) a. If you want to go to Harlem, you have to / should take the A train.\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. If you want to go to Harlem, take the A train.\
&nbsp;\          We show that (i) conditional imperatives give rise to a form of 'conditional endorsement', while conditionalized modal sentences do not; and (ii) that a robust endorsement implication surprisingly 'creeps into' the interpretation of unconditional modal sentences in certain circumstances. We argue that a Condoravdi & Lauer (2012)-style analysis of imperatives is well-equipped to account for (i), and explore several avenues for accounting for the puzzling (ii).</span>\

&nbsp;\           "Ambiguity and alignment without a common prior"

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">While ambiguity is a pervasive property of natural language communication, it is often characterized as suboptimal. Notwithstanding, recent investigations have proposed ambiguity's vindication to lie in the exploitation of contextual information. Building on these insights, I propose a signaling model that takes context, as well as interlocutors with heterogeneous contextual expectations, i.e. different priors, into consideration. The talk will deal with the question how prior heterogeneity can be overcome, and on the conditions that ensure successful ambiguous communication. Put differently, we will focus on the question whether and when the claim that context can be exploited is justified if interlocutors do not share the same prior. Our main goal is to put forward a model to evaluate predictions about ambiguity's putative advantages and the involved risk of misunderstanding. In doing so, we will touch upon issues related to lexical ambiguity, linguistic convergence in dialogue, and, if time allows, Horn's division of pragmatic labor.</span>\
