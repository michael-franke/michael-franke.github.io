July 5, 2016\    <span style = "color:firebrick">Ryan Cotterell</span> (Johns Hopkins)\
&nbsp;\          "Modeling Word Forms Using Latent Underlying Morphs and Phonology"

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">The observed pronunciations or spellings of words are often explained as arising from the “underlying forms” of their morphemes. These forms are latent strings that linguists try to reconstruct by hand. We propose to reconstruct them automatically at scale, enabling generalization to new words. Given some surface word types of a concatenative language along with the abstract morpheme sequences that they express, we show how to recover consistent underlying forms for these morphemes, together with the (stochastic) phonology that maps each concatenation of underlying forms to a surface form. Our technique involves loopy belief propagation in a natural directed graphical model whose variables are unknown strings and whose conditional distributions are encoded as finite-state machines with trainable weights. We define training and evaluation paradigms for the task of surface word prediction, and report results on subsets of 7 languages.</span>\

&nbsp;\          "Robustness in phonetic systems: Evidence from phoneme frequencies and iterated learning"

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">When speakers of a language communicate with one another, they frequently do so in noisy and sometimes rapidly changing acoustic environments. Language is structured so as to resist these perturbations. I will present two projects on the robustness of spoken language. First, a typological study showing that languages prefer phonemes that are perceptually distinct. Second, an iterated learning experiment showing how robust movement-to-acoustic mappings change the course of language evolution. Together with computational models, these studies show that languages evolve under communicative pressures to maintain function in spite of noise.</span>\

&nbsp;\           "The interaction of functional pressure, redundancy and category variation in phonetic systems"

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">At the level of individual speakers, evidence from natural speech corpora and laboratory investigations shows that the existence of similar lexical items promotes hyperarticulation of phonetic cues that distinguish them. In parallel, at diachronic time-scales evidence suggests that phoneme inventories evolve under the influence of a bias toward maintenance of existing lexico-semantic distinctions. How might these be causally related? Here we present simple exemplar-based simulations that help us explore hypotheses about a general linking mechanism between pressure to maintain lexical contrasts in individual usage events, and maintenance of phonemic contrasts over diachronic time scales. We show that redundancy in sound categories interacts with communicative pressure to modulate ‘cryptic variation’ in sound categories and show that within the model, this sub-phonemic variation shapes future sound change. </span>\

June 13, 2016\   <span style = "color:firebrick">Marie-Christine Meyer</span> (Berlin)\
&nbsp;\           "Structural conditions on implicature computation: The latest news"

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">This talk has two goals. First, to introduce the audience to an ongoing and open-ended debate in the field of formal pragmatics. The debate builds on seminal work by R. Katzir (2007, 2008, 2014) and concerns the role of structure in the definition of the set of alternatives that can be used in the computation of (scalar) implicatures. Structural constraints on alternatives have been shown to provide a solution to the so-called Symmetry Problem (Kroch 1972, von Fintel & Heim 1997), and more general well-formedness conditions on alternatives have been argued to underlie otherwise unrelated phenomena (e.g. Meyer 2015). But the idea that alternatives are structural objects which may as such be subject to structural constraints has recently come under attack in view of data that Katzir’s original proposal cannot account for (Swanson 2010, Trinh & Haida 2015, Romoli 2013). These new data will bring us to the second goal of the talk: To present even more new, i.e., newest data. I will argue that most of the seemingly problematic issues have been insufficiently analyzed and that factors which are completely independent of structural constraints on alternatives, viz.,the presupposition of contrastive connectives (e.g., Toosarvandani 2013) and principles of information encoding (e.g., Parikh 2001) have to be taken into account. Once this is accomplished, a new classification of the data ensues which makes it possible to disentangle genuine issues of the structural approach on the one hand, and confounding factors on the other.</span>\

June 6, 2016\    <span style = "color:firebrick">Sven Lauer</span> (G&ouml;ttingen & Konstanz)\
&nbsp;\          "(Un)conditional imperatives, (un)conditional modals, and (un)conditional endorsement"\
&nbsp;\          (Joint work with Cleo Condoravdi, Stanford University)

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:grey">A modal declarative like (1) can simply report that something is necessary, given a body of rules/laws/regulations, etc. without the speaker taking any position on the matter.\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) (In view of what the law provides,) you have to file a tax return.\
&nbsp;\          Things are different with imperatives. A sentence like (2) apparently indicates that the speaker wants the addressee to file a tax return.\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) File a tax return!\
&nbsp;\          This 'endorsement' implication is unsurprising for 'directive' uses of imperatives as orders, requests, pleas, and so forth, but it can also be detected for other uses of imperatives, e.g. as advice, invitations, permissions and concessions (Schwager, 2006; Kaufmann, 2012; Condoravdi & Lauer, 2012). This indicates that 'endorsement' is a conventional feature of the imperative form.\
&nbsp;\          We probe into the nature of the endorsement inference by examining conditional sentences with modal and imperative consequents, in particular those of the 'anankastic' type:\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) a. If you want to go to Harlem, you have to / should take the A train.\
&nbsp;\          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. If you want to go to Harlem, take the A train.\
&nbsp;\          We show that (i) conditional imperatives give rise to a form of 'conditional endorsement', while conditionalized modal sentences do not; and (ii) that a robust endorsement implication surprisingly 'creeps into' the interpretation of unconditional modal sentences in certain circumstances. We argue that a Condoravdi & Lauer (2012)-style analysis of imperatives is well-equipped to account for (i), and explore several avenues for accounting for the puzzling (ii).</span>\

April 25, 2016\  <span style = "color:firebrick">Thomas Brochhagen</span> (Amsterdam)\
&nbsp;\           "Ambiguity and alignment without a common prior"

&nbsp;\          <span style = "color:gray">While ambiguity is a pervasive property of natural language communication, it is often characterized as suboptimal. Notwithstanding, recent investigations have proposed ambiguity's vindication to lie in the exploitation of contextual information. Building on these insights, I propose a signaling model that takes context, as well as interlocutors with heterogeneous contextual expectations, i.e. different priors, into consideration. The talk will deal with the question how prior heterogeneity can be overcome, and on the conditions that ensure successful ambiguous communication. Put differently, we will focus on the question whether and when the claim that context can be exploited is justified if interlocutors do not share the same prior. Our main goal is to put forward a model to evaluate predictions about ambiguity's putative advantages and the involved risk of misunderstanding. In doing so, we will touch upon issues related to lexical ambiguity, linguistic convergence in dialogue, and, if time allows, Horn's division of pragmatic labor.</span>\
