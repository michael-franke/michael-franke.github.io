The goal of a research apprenticeship is to convey practical experience in the focal research topics of our institute and to lead students through individual guidance to independent research. Students are expected to work independently and to be self-motivated. Mentors will offer guidance, feedback and advice in regular meetings or other appropriate form. 

Below is a list of possible topics offered by various members of our institute. Interested students should contact potential mentors for further information.

|**areas** | language variation and change, language structure
|**contact**  | [Christian Bentz](http://www.christianbentz.de/)
|   | Human language is an information encoding device. This apprenticeship aims to familiarize students with the theory of information and how it relates to research in linguistics. The RA offers several topics: 1) language variation: information-theoretic accounts of linguistic diversity, 2) language change: the evolution of information-encoding in human languages, 3) language structure: investigating the difference between language and other communication systems. Depending on preferences and skills, these topics can entail detailed literature reviews, (small scale) corpus building, basic statistical analyses and visualizations with R.

|**areas** | language processing, language structure
|**contact**  | [Taraka Rama](taraka-rama.kasicheyanula@uni-tuebingen.de)
|   | Students can take up the following projects. 1) Identify a language group and then collect word lists for the language group and document the decisions made through data collection. The end result would be to make the student acquainted with a language family and then apply phylogenetic methods and publish a paper. 2) The project is to implement a paper about sequence alignment or a machine learning paper and apply it for phylogenetics. 3) Phylogenetic from web. There are many resources on the web that have to be harvested for phylogenetic purposes. The student will write scripts to process the data and convert the data into machine readable formats. Then, the student can apply ML techniques for analyzing the data.

|**areas** | language processing, language structure
|**contact**  | [Michael Franke](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~mfranke/)  
|   | We will study probabilistic cognitive modeling from a Bayesian point of view, in the style of Lee & Wagenmakers ([2015](https://bayesmodels.com/)). The apprenticeship will familiarize students with the basics of Bayesian data analysis and its main tools. We will then go through some of the key examples in Lee & Wagenmakers' textbook and round the project off with a novel and individual case study based on linguistic data.

|**areas** | language structure
|**contact** | [Michael Franke](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~mfranke/)  
|   | Students embark on a guided literature study on a current topic in formal semantics or pragmatics. Students will learn to survey the state-of-the-art and relate various theoretical positions to each other critically. Possible topics include but are not limited to: modified numerals; presupposition & at-issuenss; conversational implicature; conditionals, modals and probability expressions. The project culminates in a self-contained position paper in which students critically summarize the extant literature and ideally make a positive novel contribution of their own.
