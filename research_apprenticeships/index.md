The goal of a research apprenticeship is to convey practical experience in the focal research topics of our institute and to lead students through individual guidance to independent research. Students are expected to work independently and to be self-motivated. Mentors will offer guidance, feedback and advice in regular meetings or other appropriate form. 

Below is a list of possible topics offered by various members of our institute. Interested students should contact potential mentors for further information.

|   | We will study probabilistic cognitive modeling from a Bayesian point of view, in the style of Lee & Wagenmakers ([2015](https://bayesmodels.com/)). The apprenticeship will familiarize students with the basics of Bayesian data analysis and its main tools. We will then go through some of the key examples in Lee & Wagenmaker's textbook and round the project off with a novel and individual case study based on linguistic data.

|   | Students embark on a guided literature study on a current topic in formal semantics or pragmatics. Students will learn to survey the state-of-the-art and relate various theoretical positions to each other critically. Possible topics include but are not limited to: modified numerals; presupposition & at-issuenss; conversational implicature; conditionals, modals and probability expressions. The project culminates in a self-contained position paper in which students critically summarize the extant literature and ideally make a positive novel contribution of their own.
