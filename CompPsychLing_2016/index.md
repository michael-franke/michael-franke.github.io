### time and venue

The course will take place on Wednesdays from 10 to 12 in room 1.13.

### goal

**This is a reading & discussion class.** We will read selected papers where different kinds of computational models are applied to various forms of empirical data. To cover a range of topics and to illustrate the commonality of applications in various domains, we will look at syntax, semantics, pragmatics and acquisition. The goal of this course is to convey a feeling for what it means to link model predictions with (aspects) of an empirical data set.

### procedure

We will read one or two papers per session. **Everybody must have studied each paper carefully at home.** Remaining questions will be answered in class. We will then indulge lavishly in collective reflection and discussion on each paper's potential merits, weaknesses, implications and open issues.

### examination

Each class begins with a very short quiz (2 - 4 questions, possibly multiple choice) about the text that we will discuss in that class. All quizes receive scores. In order to be admitted to the final exam, it is necessary to have at least 70% of the maximally possible total score from all quizes. The grade is based on the score from the final exam.

For a "Proseminar Schein" (3 credit points), participants can use one wildcard: they will not have to do the quiz and the exam questions for one paper of their choice. Which paper to use the wildcard for should be communicated in advance. For a "Hauptseminar Schein", pariticipants can either stop after the final exam (3 credit points), or engage in an additional course project (literature discussion, programming project etc) for an additional 3 credit points.
