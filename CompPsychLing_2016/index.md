### time and venue

The course will take place on Wednesdays from 10 to 12 in room 1.13.

### goal

**This is a reading & discussion class.** We will read selected papers where different kinds of computational models are applied to various forms of empirical data. To cover a range of topics and to illustrate the commonality of applications in various domains, we will look at syntax, semantics, pragmatics and acquisition. The goal of this course is to convey a feeling for what it means to link model predictions with (aspects) of an empirical data set.

### procedure

After some general introduction during the first session, we will read one or two papers per session. **Everybody must have studied each paper carefully at home.** Remaining questions will be answered in class. We will then indulge lavishly in collective reflection and discussion on each paper's potential merits, weaknesses, implications and open issues.
